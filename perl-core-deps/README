For ska3-prime, the core deps tar source package was updated manually to
include updates for IO::Socket::SSL and Net::SSLeay. Updates were accomplished
by just replacing the previous file versions in the CPAN source tarball and
manually updating the cpan/modules/02packages.details.txt list of packages
with the new versions.

If one needs to do a full update, the strategy would be to modify the build.sh
in this package to save a mirrored index of the cpanminus-fetched packages, tar
that directory up, and then use that tarball as the new source package for the
conda package.

A modification at the top of build.sh would look like:

CPAN_ARCHIVE=/tmp/mycpan
mkdir -p ${CPAN_ARCHIVE}/modules
wget https://www.cpan.org/modules/02packages.details.txt -O ${CPAN_ARCHIVE}/modules/02packages.details.txt
CPANM="cpanm --mirror-index ${CPAN_ARCHIVE}/modules/02packages.details.txt \
--self-contained --save-dists ${CPAN_ARCHIVE}"
