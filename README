This repository includes a build script and recipes to build
"static" pieces of our ska3 environment.  By static, we just mean
not in active development; we plan to build these basically once.

Many of the pieces are being actively phased out, for example, the
xtime code is used by the Chandra::Time Perl module, but modern
applications are moving to Python and cxotime for time operations.
See starcheck 14.0.1 for code to call Python from Perl using a client
server model.

For the prime installation I had attempted to modernize to get Inline::Python
to work with Python 3.10.8 but did not have success with compiling on OSX.
Inline::Python has been removed from perl-core-deps.
There is an archived recipe that worked for Linux.

To build the minimum package set required to run starcheck (and run/debug
task_schedule) from OSX, the default package set of:

    'perl-core-deps'
    'perl-ska-classic' # Includes Quat

should be sufficient.  To build a more complete Perl environment on Linux
to support applications like Replan Central and splat.pl, the bonus packages
should be built by supplying the "all" argument to build.py:

bonus_pkgs = [
    'xtime',
    'perl-extended-deps', # Includes PDL and SSL libraries for Ska::Web
    'perl-chandra-time', 
    'perl-cxc-sysarch',
    'perl-app-env-ascds',
    'perl-ska-convert',
    'perl-ska-agasc',
    'perl-ska-web', # Used to fetch data in Replan Central
    'perl-dbd-sybase', # Support Sybase
    'perl-tk'] # Includes Tk for aca_movie or splat
